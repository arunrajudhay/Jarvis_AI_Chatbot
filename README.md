## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the Streamlit app
4. Access the app in your browser

## Approach:
1. User Interaction: The chatbot receives input from users through a web interface built with Streamlit. Users can type their queries or messages, initiating interaction.
2. Input Processing: The bot processes the incoming user input to understand intent and context. This involves tokenization and normalization of the text for accurate interpretation.
3. Database Querying: If the user query requires fetching specific information, the bot connects to the MySQL database using mysql.connector. It retrieves relevant data based on the user's request, such as user history or predefined responses.
4. Response Generation: Utilizing the LangChain library, the bot generates contextual responses. It employs pre-trained language models (like those from the Ollama library) to formulate replies based on the input and retrieved data.
5. Output Delivery: The bot presents the generated response back to the user through the Streamlit interface, ensuring the conversation flows naturally.
6. Logging and Feedback: Each interaction is logged for analysis and improvement. The bot collects feedback on responses to enhance future interactions and training of the language model.
7. Session Management: The bot maintains user sessions to provide personalized interactions, allowing users to have continuous conversations without losing context.
8. Performance Monitoring: Implement monitoring to track bot performance, response times, and user satisfaction. This data is used to optimize the chatbotâ€™s effectiveness over time.

## Learning Outcomes of This Project:
